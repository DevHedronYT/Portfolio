                I am DevHedron. I am mainly a programmer as you can see and I can do 
                web development as well as game development. The language I mainly use 
                right now is C but I am experienced in Python as well and a bit of JavaScript. 
                I can also use multiple technologies especially in Python, stuff like handling
                requests and stuff... I usually make programming videos and am interested
                in other subjects as well like Maths and Science and some more. You 
                can contact me at my Discord, DevHedron#7692. I am mostly active on 
                GitHub, itch.io and YouTube. Here are the links:
